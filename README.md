This notebook is designed to aid with tedious matrix related calculations.  
Input a matrix with a given number of rows.  
For each row input a space seperated list of elements, e.g 1 0 0 2 1  

*The following will be calculated for the input matrix A:*  
1. The eigenvectors, eigenvalues and multiplicities.  
2. The characteristic polynomial.
3. Interactive minimal polynomial calculator. (Pretty epic imo).
4. JCF and RCF Helper (Doesn't actually find RCF)
5. Gram Schmidt
6. fx-CG420 (Freeform calculator).
